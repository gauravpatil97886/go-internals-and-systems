# go-internals-and-systems

A deep, hands-on repository for mastering **Golang internals, concurrency, performance, and backend system design**.

This repository documents my journey from Go fundamentals to advanced internals and real-world backend systems.  
Every folder contains **working code**, **experiments**, and **clear explanations** focused on *why things work the way they do*, not just how to use them.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

Most Go tutorials stop at syntax.  
This repository goes deeper.

The goals are to:
- Understand **how Go works internally**
- Write **high-performance, predictable, production-ready code**
- Learn **system-level thinking** used in real backend services
- Build a strong mental model of **trade-offs and design decisions**

This is not a collection of random snippets — it is a **structured learning system**.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn Here

- How Go manages **memory, stack, heap, and garbage collection**
- How **goroutines, schedulers, and channels** actually work
- How to design **concurrent, scalable systems**
- How to reason about **latency, throughput, and bottlenecks**
- How real backend services are structured in Go
